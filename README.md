# Advanced Recommender Systems : iGSLR - 11/04/2020

The purpose of this project is to implement a location-based recommender system from regular location-based social network (LBSN) data. Usually LBSN data give precise information regarding the locations visited by the users. These data also reveal who are the friends of the users. These two information (geographical + social) can be exploited into a standard collaborative filtering approach. At the end of this project we have all the building blocks of the model iGSLR, a geo-social location recommendation model.
